# Parallel Additions Project

This project contains two Java programs demonstrating parallel computation techniques applied to vector and matrix addition.

## Overview

- **Vector Addition (VectorAddition.java):** Adds two vectors using multiple threads with static workload distribution.
- **Matrix Addition (MatrixAddition.java):** Adds two matrices in parallel using multiple threads, also with static workload distribution.

Both programs divide the workload evenly among threads to perform addition efficiently and demonstrate basic parallel programming concepts in Java.

## Usage

Compile and run each program separately. Both are self-contained Java applications.
