# BruteForceDNAStringMatch

This project demonstrates a parallel brute-force string matching algorithm applied to a large DNA sequence file. The implementation is adapted to process large biological datasets such as the **E.coli DNA sequence** from the Canterbury Large Corpus.

## üìÅ Files Included

| File Name            | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Œïcoli_BruteForceDNAStringMatch.java`         | Main program that performs multithreaded brute-force matching of a pattern. |

## üß¨ Dataset Required

Download the DNA sequence file `E.coli` from the Canterbury Corpus:

üîó [E.coli DNA file (Canterbury Corpus)](https://corpus.canterbury.ac.nz/descriptions/#large)

To simulate a large enough dataset for performance benchmarking, concatenate the file multiple times
