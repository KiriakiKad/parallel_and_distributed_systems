# Parallel and Distributed Systems - Shared Variable Synchronization Examples

This repository contains 8 Java classes that demonstrate the use of shared variables and mutual exclusion using threads and `ReentrantLock`. These examples are adapted from exercises in Lab 2 and Lab 3 of a university course on parallel and distributed systems.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

### `Mutual_exclusion/`

This folder includes implementations for:

- Global and fine-grained locking
- Shared counter access using threads
- Array element updates using locks
- Thread-safe object-based counters

## üìÑ Included Examples

| Class Name                                                | Description |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `SharedCounterGlobalLockExample.java`                     | Uses a global `ReentrantLock` to protect access to all array elements. Demonstrates coarse-grained synchronization with shared counter. |
| `SharedCounterFineGrainedLockExample.java`                | Demonstrates fine-grained locking where each array index has its own lock. Threads safely increment elements concurrently. |
| `SharedCounterObjectLockExample.java`                     | Shows how a counter object with a `ReentrantLock` protects concurrent increments in a multi-threaded environment.  |
| `SharedCounterObjectSynchronizedMethodExample.java`       | Counter is incremented safely using a `synchronized` method. Illustrates method-level synchronization. |
| `SharedCounterGlobalWhileExample.java`                    | Combines a global counter and `while` loop to allocate work to threads, ensuring no overlap with synchronized access.  |
| `SharedCounterArrayNoSyncExample.java`                    | Demonstrates a race condition when multiple threads update a shared array without any synchronization. |
| `SharedCounterArrayGlobalLockExample.java`                | Threads update array elements using a shared global lock, avoiding race conditions but with reduced concurrency. |
| `SharedCounterArrayFineLockExample.java`                  | Each array index is protected with an individual `ReentrantLock`, allowing concurrent updates safely.  |
