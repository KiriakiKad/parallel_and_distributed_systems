/*
 * MultiplesThreaded.java
 *
 * This Java program creates 10 threads.
 * Each thread calculates and prints the first 20 multiples of its own number (from 1 to 10).
 * For example, thread for number 3 will print:
 *   1*3=3
 *   2*3=6
 *   ...
 * 
 * Since threads run concurrently, the output may appear interleaved due to thread scheduling.
 *
 * How to Compile and Run:
 * javac MultiplesThreaded.java
 * java MultiplesThreaded
 */

/*
As observed, the output of the threads is not in a logical sequence but rather mixed up.
This happens due to thread scheduling and the non-deterministic execution of threads.
Scheduling determines which thread runs at any moment, and the OS can decide
which thread will be active at any given time.
Therefore, threads can be interrupted and resumed out of order.
Also, non-deterministic execution means thereâ€™s no fixed sequence
in which threads execute their routines.
