# Threading Examples Basics

This folder contains basic Java threading examples demonstrating how to create and run threads using different approaches. The examples illustrate creating threads from different classes, running multiple threads concurrently, and calculating multiples with threads.

## Included Programs

1. **CustomThreadsExample.java**  
   Creates two threads, each from a different class, showcasing different run() methods.

2. **MultipleThreadsExample.java**  
   Extends the previous example by creating 10 threads of each class.

3. **MultiplesThreaded.java**  
   Creates 10 threads where each thread computes and prints the first 20 multiples of its assigned number concurrently.

4. **MultiplesThreadedSequential.java**  
   Similar to `MultiplesThreaded.java` but runs threads sequentially to show the difference in output order.
