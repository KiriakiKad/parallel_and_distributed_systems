/*
 * MultiplesThreadedSequential.java
 *
 * This is a variation of the previous program.
 * It creates and executes threads one at a time â€” each thread starts, finishes, and then the next begins.
 *
 * As a result, the output is clean and ordered (no interleaving between threads).
 *
 * How to Compile and Run:
 * javac MultiplesThreadedSequential.java
 * java MultiplesThreadedSequential
 */
/*
In this version, each thread executes sequentially.
Its output completes before the next thread starts,
so the output follows a logical order.
The key addition is the ThreadExecute() method,
which creates a thread and waits for it to finish before continuing.
